# The perfect font for 1440p.

Back when my computer had a 1080p monitor, I made a heavily stylized [3x Font](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/3x-font), due to issues with scaling up/down 32x/64x fonts.

In the process of studying Minecraft's font system, I found there were several stylistic choices made in Minecraft's default font (and thereby other vanilla-inspired fonts) that I didn't particularly like, so I took the liberty of changing them when I created 3x Font.

When I recently switched to a 1440p monitor (and thus GUI scale 4) I decided I'd repeat the process for GUI Scale 4. Behold: the **4x Font** project.

As of Version 1, only basic ASCII has been completed. Future versions will include support for accented characters and nonlatin European characters. I also plan to implement the "replace SGA with English characters" modification just for fun.
