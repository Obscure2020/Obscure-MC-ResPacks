# The perfect font for 1440p.

On Christmas Day 2022, I recieved a computer upgrade as a gift. A new laptop to replace my previous low-end model. Besides swapping out 4 CPU cores for 8 and a ***massive*** uplift in GPU power, my new laptop came with a 1440p display. It was time for me to graduate from GUI Scale 3 (for which I had previously made a [custom font](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/3x-font)) to GUI Scale 4.

Now, I am a longtime user of [VanillaXBR](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/vanillaxbr), which is essentially tailor-made for GUI Scale 4 since it's a 64x pack. In fact, I've been a proud member of the [VanillaXBR Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8N4xzej) server for years now. Only one issue with it in my eyes: I don't particularly like the font!

In the process of creating [3x Font](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/3x-font), I realized there were several stylistic choices made in Minecraft's default font (and the fonts provided by most vanilla-inspired packs, like VanillaXBR) that I just didn't really like. Making my own font, I was free to overwrite those choices with letterforms that better suited my tastes. So I decided I'd repeat the process for GUI Scale 4. Behold: the **4x Font** project.

As of Version 1, only basic ASCII has been completed. Future versions will include support for accented characters and nonlatin European characters. I also plan to implement the "replace SGA with English characters" modification just for fun.
