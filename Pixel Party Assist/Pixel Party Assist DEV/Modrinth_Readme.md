Ever tried playing Pixel Party on Hypixel? Ever thought that Minecraft's (non-glazed) terracotta was difficult to differentiate? Well then, I've got just the resource pack for you!\

Just about 'nuff said with that picture right there. This resource pack makes Pixel Party ***WAY*** easier to play. Expect a YouTube video about this pack to be added to this page soon. I'm currently out of town for a few days, so I'm away from my microphone.

## Supports 1.8.9 as well!
Personally, I use a modern Fabric mod stack built upon the newest release of Minecraft. I am aware, though, that many folks use a 1.8.9 instance for playing on Hypixel to maximize compatiblity. For this reason, I have provided a version of this pack that is compatible with Minecraft 1.8.9.
